# Dev-Detective

Project Name - Dev Detective

Made a simple pretty GitHub Profile Searcher using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript

It utilizes the GitHub API to fetch user profiles and present them in a sleek UI directly on the website.

It also features a sleek, customizable UI with light and dark themes.

And that's not all â€“ it even remembers your preferred theme so you don't have to switch back and forth every time you use it.

You can use it to send beautiful screenshots of your Github profile to your friends and recruiters.

I learned a lot about :-

1) Theme Switching CSS (Light to Dark mode)
2) API Calling and presenting the data neatly
3) Use of Local Storage/Session Storage
4) Error Handling

Tech Stack - HTML, CSS, and Javascript
